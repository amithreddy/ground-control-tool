### What is this? ###

This is a prototype of a tool visualises stope sizes in metal mines by using Mathewsâ€™ Stability Graph. The tool allows a ground control engineer to visualise which faces of a stope are in the stable or unstable zone and make decisions accordingly.![Screenshot from 2016-11-07 21-42-16.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/pnLqyr/images/1076202447-Screenshot%20from%202016-11-07%2021-42-16.png)

This is tool is **not ready** to be used in this state. It is only for my showcase.
