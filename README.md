This is a prototype of a tool visualises stope sizes in metal mines by using Mathewsâ€™ Stability Graph. The tool allows a ground control engineer to visualise which faces of a stope are in the stable or unstable zone and make decisions accordingly.

This is tool is **not ready** to be used in this state. It is only for my showcase.
